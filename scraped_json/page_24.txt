Stanford’s China Guiding Cases Project Bids Farewell After 10 Years of Excellence
When we founded the China Guiding Cases Project (the “CGCP”) of Stanford Law School in February 2011, we did not expect the project to take us to various important forums where we could share our insights globally.  These forums included the World Bank, the Open Government Partnership, the Supreme People’s Court of China, and the Belt & Road Initiative conference organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China.
We did not expect that our commentaries would lead to a call for the publication of a quarterly, bilingual journal.  In response to the call, we launched China Law Connect in June 2018.  The 13 issues of the journal have brought more than 140,000 new readers to the CGCP website, allowing us to share our analyses of China’s Guiding Cases and related topics with a total of 220,000 global readers since the founding of the CGCP.
The world has changed and new issues have emerged.  The core CGCP team has decided to move on to new ventures with the potential to produce even more impact.  We thank you very much for your support.  To express our gratitude, we are releasing all of the content of China Law Connect.  Feel free to download individual articles or entire issues of the journal below.
The CGCP is coming to an end, but the mission to bring about positive changes in China and improve understanding of China through in-depth analyses continues.
